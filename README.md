# Data Structures
Projects of the subject Data Structures, of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, semester 2018.2

## Simple linked list
### Objective
To develop and test classes in `C++`  that build the simple linked list data structure.

### Folder description
- **_/QtProj_**: Folder containing all files needed for the completion of the first project, plus the `.pro` file used to build the project through the [Qt Creator IDE](https://www.qt.io/download). This folder contains:
    - *filename.h*: Classes used in the project.
    - *Teste(...).cpp*: Files with different `main` functions, used to test each step of the project.
    - *filename.txt*: Files that will be read by the `.cpp` files.

- **_/zip_**: Folder containing the root files `.tgz` provided by the teacher at the beginning of the project.

- **_praticaMOD1a.pdf_**: The `.pdf` file containing full instructions *in portuguese* for the realization of this project.

## Sorting Algorithms
### Objective
To develop and test classes in `Java`  that build a few examples of sorting algorithms.

### Folder description
- **_/mergesort_**: Folder containing the implemented *MergeSort* class, plus tests used to prove the sorting capacity of this code. To try it, open and run the `Ex1.java` file.

- **_/dutchflag_**: Folder containing the implemented *DutchFlag* class, plus tests used to prove the sorting capacity of this code. To try it, open and run the `Ex2.java` file.

- **_/quicksort_**: Folder containing the implemented *QuickSort* class, plus tests used to prove the sorting capacity of this code. To try it, open and run the `Ex3.java` file.

- **_praticaMOD2.pdf_**: The `.pdf` file containing full instructions *in portuguese* for the realization of this project.

- **_praticaMOD2.zip_**: The `.rar` provided by the teacher at the beginning of the project. It contains the unchanged files from the project assignment.
